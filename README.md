Well, not anymore. This repo contains everything you need to create an innovative and creative application. The cool thing is, you can have some fun on the way. Clone this repo and reuse everything to create your own fancy application to your dream job. 

## What can you expect?

Apart from some nice action workflows used in this repo, you will get everything you need to stand out during your application and interview process. In total you will find the following shortcuts:

<ol>
    <li>a kickass cover letter</li>
    <li>a kickass CV</li>
    <li>a python bot that helps you prep for your interview</li>
    <li>a nerdy webpage that helps you present yourself</li>
    <li>a python library and a demo notebook with a Data Science showcase</li>
</ol>

So, let's go into detail and best start with the application.

### The application

Hiring managers see tons of CVs and cover letters each day. So it can't hurt to have a visually appealing first introduction of yourself. I tweaked a super amazing <code>.tex</code> template by Jan KÃ¼ster and Jan Vorisek a little and added it here. The originals can be found <a href="https://www.latextemplates.com/template/developer-cv">here</a>.
