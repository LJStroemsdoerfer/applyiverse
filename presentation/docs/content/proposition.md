# What do I bring to the table?

## ðŸ’» Digitalization
***
Digitalization is key for our business and to deliver on our endeavour we need to leverage latest open source technology and most importantly: we need to bring people and technology together. As a tech aficionado and people leader, I am helping to achieve our goals.

## ðŸš€ Innovation
***
As a Data Scientist I am used to improving business processes by automating tedious and manual tasks. We don't put people out of work, but we ease their job and create time for value creation instead of repetitive work.

## ðŸ‘· Leadership
***
As a Tech Lead I know that what makes technology succesfull are the people interacting with it. People need to be taking with on that journey, trained on how to best use technology and most importantly, empowered to improve it.
